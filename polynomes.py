    These polynoms are made so that teir coefficients could be anything that
    can be added, substracted, multiplied and divided.

    IMPORTANT: the coefficients are reversed compared to the convetionnal order.
    The main reason for that is that the implementation is very next to the
    mathematical definition of polynoms, that is using that order.

    Example:
        >>> one = Polynom([1])
        >>> identity = Polynom([0, 1])  # means 0 + 1*x
        >>> double = Polynom([0, 2])  # means 0 + 2*x
        >>> x_plus_one = Polynom([1, 1])  # means 1 + 1*x
        >>> x_squared = Polynom([0, 0, 1])  # means 0 + 0*x + 1*x**2
        >>> poly = x_squared + one  # adding up two polynoms makes a new one !
        >>> x_squared + x_plus_one  # add up two ones... easy to guess !
